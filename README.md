# OI DataConverter

A tool used to generate output files quickly and easily.

When preparing OI datas, you may have a generator to make **input datas** and a **standard program** to make output files. But how to make 20, or even 100 sets of datas?

By modifying the file name in your standard program? too compicated! Use our tool to make things simple!

##How to get the release version?

You can download the release version by [clicking here]().

##System requirements

Because of the use of function "getch()", the current version of data converter can only support Microsoft Windows.

Fell free to post pull request to share your solutions.

##About coding

This source code is originaly written by DEV-CPP at the year of 2016, which is a time when I only have little experience in making large programs(Not saying that I have experience now).

In that situation, the code is unprofessional and doesn't match the standard of large programs. But I decided to post them on GitHub anyway in the thoughts of studying and sharing. Because although there are shortcommings, but the system is really interesting, especially the automatic matching system and analyse systems.

If you have any great ideas about how to improve this progrm, fell free to post "Issues" and "Pull requests" to make your contribution.
